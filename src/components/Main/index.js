                            Hi there, I'm Christina. I'm a Full Stack web developer with a background in fire protection
                            engineering and building life safety codes. I recently earned a certificate in full stack web
                            development from the University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp, with newly developed skills in
                            JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. With an engineering consulting and design
                            background, I am proficient in developing creative solutions to complex problems, have experience
                            meeting short deadlines with efficiency, and collaborating with team members to maintain the overall
                            vision of the project at hand. With each project, my aim is to develop a user friendly and
                            efficient, responsive design that makes the userâ€™s life easier in any way possible.
                    <br /> <br />
                                    I grew up in a small Kansas town, graduated with a degree in Architectural Engineering from the
                                    University of Kansas, and moved to Kansas City, MO where I currently work as a Fire Protection
                                    Engineer and Building Life Safety Code Consultant. Fire Protection can be pretty interesting at
                                    times. I create fire and smoke simulations that show where the toxic chemicals build up, which then
                                    allows me to build an effective smoke control system to remove the smoke so occupants can exit
                                    safely. That's the fun part of my job. The other part, which is what most of my days consist of, is
                                    largely reviewing building codes and drawings to ensure the building meets these laws. While I enjoy
                                    my work life and atmosphere, I've been feeling rather stagnant in my career. I feel that software
                                    development is more up my alley, and would be more stimulating to me personally.

                                        In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies and activities. Some of these things include playing
                                        board games, watching movies/TV, making stained glass art, candlemaking, doing various arts and
                                        crafts, roller blading, cooking, playing Dungeons
                                        and Dragons, having virtual game night with my friends, dancing, putting together outfits and makeup
                                        looks, going out for a drink (when there
                                        isn't a pandemic), taking my dog for a walk, moving furniture around
                                        my house, and learning more and more about coding, of course!
